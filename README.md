# Goal of this project:

Implement an application that plays the card game of [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) using the rules [here](https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/war/).

Create a RESTful service with two endpoints:
- An endpoint to start a game. Two simulated players will play out the game.
- An endpoint to get lifetime wins for each player stored in a database.
                                                                  ^watch the freecode camp video on database design
